# Mindustry Packing

Given an input containing a patch of ores, place 2x2 tiles on top such that each has a path to the outside and we maximize the number of patches covered while minimizing the number of 2x2 tiles.

Paths can only go in the 4 cardinal directions.

## Sample input

Note that current algorithm requires an exit tile and no miners can be placed on the edges 2 tiles in so you need to insert the filler tiles yourself.
